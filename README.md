# JAX in Astronomy @ the CCA

## What?
A week-long, hack week-style meeting to discuss and coordinate efforts in astronomy research software built with JAX. This is not a conference, or a tutorial series! Most time will be unscheduled co-working and unconference time. Our goals are to:
- Coordinate any shared infrastructure for the JAX in astronomy ecosystem,
- Collect patterns, tutorials, and examples of JAX usage in Astronomy research,
- Scope out, (co-)work on, and plan any domain projects from participants.

## When?
October 14–18, 2024

## Where?
Hosted by the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) in NYC.
