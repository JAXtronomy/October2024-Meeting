# How to deal with lightcurves

## What?
- Create a function, successfully compile, cache, and load cache after restart
  - This seems not to work on Google Collab; Skye recommends to write a ticket
- Create a function, successfully compile, export, then load, and it does not have to compile [on the same setup]
- Create a function, successfully compile, export, then load, and it does not have to compile [in distributed setting]
- Explore padding (but perhaps not possible for Gaussian processes)
